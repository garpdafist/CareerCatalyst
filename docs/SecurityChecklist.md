4. Review PII handling practices for compliance with relevant regulations

## API Security

### Current Implementation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Authentication | ✅ Implemented | Session-based authentication for API routes |
| Input Validation | ⚠️ Partial | Zod validation exists but not consistently applied |
| Rate Limiting | ❌ Missing | No API rate limiting implemented |
| Error Handling | ⚠️ Partial | Some routes expose internal error details |
| Logging | ⚠️ Partial | Basic logging implemented but not comprehensive |
| API Documentation | ❌ Missing | No formal API documentation |
| OpenAI API Security | ✅ Implemented | API key stored securely server-side |

### Recommendations

1. Implement consistent input validation for all API endpoints
2. Add rate limiting for API routes to prevent abuse
3. Standardize error handling to avoid leaking implementation details
4. Enhance logging for security-relevant events
5. Create API documentation

## Frontend Security

### Current Implementation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| XSS Protection | ⚠️ Partial | React provides some protection but no explicit measures |
| Content Security Policy | ❌ Missing | No CSP headers implemented |
| Secure Dependencies | ❓ Unknown | No regular audit process documented |
| Local Storage Usage | ✅ Implemented | Minimal sensitive data in localStorage |
| Secure Form Handling | ✅ Implemented | Using React Hook Form with validation |
| File Upload Validation | ✅ Implemented | MIME type and size checks for uploads |

### Recommendations

1. Implement Content Security Policy headers
2. Add regular dependency security audits
3. Add explicit XSS protection mechanisms
4. Review client-side security practices regularly

## Infrastructure Security

### Current Implementation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| HTTPS | ✅ Implemented | All traffic uses HTTPS |
| Environment Variables | ✅ Implemented | Secrets stored as environment variables |
| Database Security | ⚠️ Partial | Basic security measures but no detailed audit |
| Logging & Monitoring | ⚠️ Partial | Basic logging but no alerting/monitoring |
| Backups | ❓ Unknown | Backup strategy not documented |
| Disaster Recovery | ❌ Missing | No documented recovery plan |

### Recommendations

1. Document and verify backup processes
2. Create a disaster recovery plan
3. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Conduct a database security audit

## Dependency Security

### Current Implementation

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Dependency Scanning | ❌ Missing | No automated scanning |
| Regular Updates | ❓ Unknown | Update frequency not documented |
| Deprecated Package Handling | ❓ Unknown | Process not documented |
| Vulnerability Tracking | ❌ Missing | No formal tracking process |

### Recommendations

1. Implement automated dependency scanning
2. Establish a regular update schedule
3. Create a process for handling vulnerable dependencies
4. Remove unused dependencies

## Compliance Considerations

### Current Implementation

|------------|--------|-------|
| GDPR | ⚠️ Partial | Some measures but not comprehensive |
| CCPA | ⚠️ Partial | Some measures but not comprehensive |
| SOC 2 | ❌ Missing | No formal compliance |
| HIPAA | ✅ N/A | Not processing health information |

### Recommendations

1. Conduct a GDPR compliance assessment
2. Implement proper data subject request handling
3. Create privacy policy and terms of service documents
4. Consider compliance needs based on target markets

## Security Roadmap

### Short-term Priorities (1-3 months)
