We need to update our Resume Analyzer page so that when a user clicks on the "View Result" button, instead of navigating to a new URL (like /resume-analyzer?id=100) and displaying the entire page, a modal popup appears that shows the analysis results. The design should be inspired by Apple’s clean, transparent, 3D layer aesthetics.

Please implement the following:

1. **Modal Popup for Analysis Results:**
   - Create a modal component that overlays the current page when "View Result" is clicked.
   - The modal should have a transparent background with a subtle 3D effect (using shadows and rounded corners) to mimic an Apple-style popup.
   - The modal content should display the analysis results (score, keywords, suggestions, etc.) in a clean, organized layout.
   - Add a close button (an “X” icon or similar) to dismiss the popup.
   - Ensure that the modal is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

2. **Remove Route-Based Navigation:**
   - Remove the existing behavior that navigates to a separate URL with an analysis ID.
   - Instead, when a user clicks "View Result," the modal should fetch and display the analysis data (using React Query or our current data fetching method) without reloading the page.

3. **Transition & Animations:**
   - Implement smooth fade-in and scale animations for the modal popup (for example, using Tailwind's transition utilities like `transition`, `duration-300`, and appropriate transform classes).
   - Ensure the popup appears as an overlay, dimming the background slightly to focus attention on the analysis results.

4. **Design Aesthetics:**
   - Use a transparent or semi-transparent background for the modal overlay.
   - Apply subtle box-shadow and rounded corners to create a 3D “floating” effect.
   - Follow our existing Tailwind theme for colors, spacing, and fonts.

5. **Fix Syntax Errors:**
   - There is a syntax error in `client/src/pages/resume-analyzer.tsx` at line 205: "Unexpected token }". Please locate and fix this error so that the code compiles correctly.
   - Ensure that all ambiguous Tailwind class warnings (like `ease-[cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)]`) are resolved by using the correct escape syntax (e.g., replace with `ease-&lsqb;cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)&rsqb;`) as needed.

6. **Documentation & Comments:**
   - Add inline comments to explain the modal component structure and the transitions/animations used.
   - Document the changes made to remove the route-based navigation for analysis results and replace it with the modal approach.

Please implement these changes and confirm once complete so we can test the new modal popup experience for the "View Result" functionality.
