Phase 2: Refactoring & Cleanup – Improving Architecture, Performance, and Efficiency

Based on our current documentation (Project Overview, Architecture, README, and Security Checklist), please proceed with a thorough refactoring of the codebase. Our goals are to remove redundancies, streamline our architecture for better performance, and ensure that all security and efficiency best practices are in place. Please follow these detailed steps:

1. Code Consolidation & Cleanup:
   - Review the entire codebase for duplicate or legacy functions. In particular, focus on:
     • Consolidating resume analysis logic for both "With Job" and "Without Job" flows into a unified, maintainable module.
     • Unifying similar functions (e.g., multiple implementations of PDF parsing) into a single, robust service. Evaluate if we really need all four PDF libraries (pdf-parse, pdf.js-extract, pdfjs-dist, pdf-lib) or if one or two can cover our use cases reliably.
     • Remove unused imports, legacy code blocks, and console.log statements that might leak sensitive data.
     • Enforce consistent naming conventions and file structures across client, server, and shared directories.
   - Update inline comments to document complex logic, especially in AI prompt construction, error handling, and fallback mechanisms.

2. Performance Optimizations:
   - Optimize the resume analysis workflow by:
     • Implementing text chunking for large resumes. If a resume exceeds a certain character/token threshold, split it into chunks, process each chunk (possibly with GPT-3.5), and then merge or summarize the results before a final in-depth analysis (with GPT-4).
     • Caching parsed PDF content using MD5 hashes or a similar mechanism to avoid repeated processing of identical documents.
     • Reviewing and, if needed, fine-tuning timeout settings and retry logic for external API calls (e.g., OpenAI API) with exponential backoff to avoid long waits or hangs.
     • Ensuring that the server’s request queue and connection handling (e.g., keep-alive settings) are optimal for a fast, responsive application.
   - Audit all API routes for potential bottlenecks and improve response times. Confirm that error handling does not block the flow and that fallback mechanisms are in place.

3. Security Enhancements During Refactoring:
   - Standardize input validation across all endpoints using Zod, ensuring every API route (resume analysis, cover letter generation, LinkedIn optimization, etc.) validates and sanitizes inputs.
   - Verify that sensitive operations (such as resume file uploads and AI analysis requests) use secure server-side API routes and that no sensitive data is directly accessible from the frontend.
   - Integrate middleware for rate limiting on critical endpoints (especially those interacting with external APIs) to prevent abuse and DDoS scenarios.
   - Ensure that CSRF protection is implemented for all state-changing operations.
   - Confirm that all error messages returned to the user are generic (e.g., "Something went wrong. Please try again later.") and that internal errors are logged securely without exposing sensitive information.

4. Documentation & Code Quality:
   - After refactoring, update the Project Overview and Architecture documents to reflect the new code structure, especially noting any consolidation (like a single PDF parsing module) and performance optimizations.
   - Generate a summary report of what was refactored, which redundant modules were removed or consolidated, and any improvements in performance or architecture clarity.
   - Add or update ESLint/Prettier configurations to enforce these coding standards going forward.

5. Final Verification:
   - Ensure that all API endpoints (resume analysis, cover letter generation, LinkedIn optimization, authentication) work as expected, both for the "With Job" and "Without Job" flows.
   - Run a full set of tests (manual or automated) to verify that performance has improved and that error handling, input validation, and security measures are consistent.
   - Document any remaining issues or potential improvements to be addressed in the next phase.

Please proceed with these changes, provide detailed logs of what is refactored, and generate a summary of improvements along with any new findings or recommendations for the next phase.
