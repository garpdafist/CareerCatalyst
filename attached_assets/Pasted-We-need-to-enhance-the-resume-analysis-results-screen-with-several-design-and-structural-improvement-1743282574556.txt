We need to enhance the resume analysis results screen with several design and structural improvements to create a more polished, cohesive, and user-friendly experience. Please implement the following changes:

1. Color Scheme:
   - Replace the current mix of red progress bars, blue highlights, and green buttons with a more cohesive color palette that aligns with our brand.
   - Consider using a monochromatic scheme with one or two accent colors for emphasis (e.g., use shades of gray with a bright accent for CTAs).

2. Typography:
   - Introduce visual hierarchy by varying font weights and sizes. Use larger, bolder fonts for headings and smaller, lighter fonts for body text.
   - Consider using a more modern, professional font family for a refined look.

3. White Space:
   - Increase padding and margins between sections (e.g., suggestion boxes, score displays) to improve readability and prevent content from feeling cramped.
   - Ensure consistent spacing across components.

4. Visual Elements:
   - Add subtle illustrations or icons to enhance the interface (for example, icons next to section headings or next to actionable items).
   - Consider using dynamic progress indicators for different sections of the analysis, such as a circular progress chart for the overall score.
   - Use animations or subtle transitions to highlight sections as they load.

5. Structural Improvements:
   - Layout Organization: 
     • Group related information together using a card-based design or subtle borders/background colors to clearly separate different analysis components.
     • Consider using tabs or an accordion layout for different types of feedback (e.g., general feedback, suggested improvements, keyword analysis) if it helps declutter the vertical scroll.
   - Information Architecture:
     • Prioritize actionable feedback by placing it more prominently on the screen.
     • Highlight the "Suggested Improvements" section, as it contains the most actionable insights.
     • Consider adding a summary dashboard at the top that gives an at-a-glance view of key metrics.
   - Navigation:
     • Add anchor links or a sticky header with key actions so users can quickly jump to sections (e.g., "Improve My Resume", "Generate Cover Letter", "Do Another Analysis").
     • Ensure that options like "Do Another Analysis" and "View Your Previous Analyses" are clearly visible without overwhelming the user.
   - Interaction Design:
     • Add hover states to interactive elements (buttons, links) to provide visual feedback.
     • Implement expandable/collapsible sections for detailed information if needed.
     • Make the "Improve My Resume" and "Generate Cover Letter" buttons visually distinct using primary and secondary button styles.

6. Integration & Consistency:
   - Ensure that these changes integrate smoothly with our existing React/TypeScript + Tailwind CSS codebase.
   - Maintain responsive design for both desktop and mobile.
   - Add inline comments explaining new CSS classes or component structure changes for future maintenance.

Please implement these changes and provide a summary of your modifications once complete.
