We are encountering two issues in our Resume Analyzer page:

1. A syntax error: "Unexpected token }" in client/src/pages/resume-analyzer.tsx at line 205. This error is likely due to a mismatched or extra closing brace that is preventing our code from compiling. Please review the code around line 205 and fix any brace mismatches.

2. The "View Results" button currently changes the URL (e.g., to /resume-analyzer?id=100) instead of opening a modal popup to display the analysis results. We want to replace this navigation with a modal popup that overlays the current page. The desired design is a modern, transparent, 3D-style popup (inspired by Apple’s design aesthetics).

Please implement the following:

A. **Fix the Syntax Error**:
   - Open `client/src/pages/resume-analyzer.tsx` and correct the syntax error at line 205 by ensuring that all braces are properly paired.

B. **Implement a Modal Popup for Viewing Results**:
   1. Modify the "View Results" button’s onClick handler so that it:
      - Prevents the default behavior of navigating (i.e., removing the URL parameter update).
      - Triggers a modal popup component instead.
   2. Create a modal component that:
      - Overlays the current page (use a semi-transparent backdrop).
      - Has a 3D, clean design with subtle shadows and rounded corners.
      - Displays the analysis results (score, feedback, keywords, etc.) in a well-organized layout.
      - Includes a close button (e.g., an “X”) to dismiss the popup.
   3. Ensure that the modal popup is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile.

C. **Remove Route-Based Navigation for Analysis Results**:
   - Remove or disable any code that updates the URL to include the analysis ID (e.g., /resume-analyzer?id=100), ensuring that all analysis viewing is handled by the modal.

D. **Documentation**:
   - Add inline comments explaining the changes made, especially around the modal component and the event handler changes.

Once these changes are implemented, please confirm so we can test the new modal popup experience for the "View Results" functionality.
