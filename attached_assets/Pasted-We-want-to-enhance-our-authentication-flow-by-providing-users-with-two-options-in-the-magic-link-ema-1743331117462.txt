We want to enhance our authentication flow by providing users with two options in the magic link email:
1. They can simply click the magic link to log in automatically.
2. Alternatively, they can use a one-time password (OTP) provided in the same email by entering it manually on the login page.

Please implement the following changes:

1. **Email Template Update:**
   - Modify our authentication email to include both:
     a. A clickable magic link.
     b. A unique, time-limited OTP code (e.g., a 6-digit numeric code).
   - Add clear instructions in the email, such as:
     "Click the magic link below to sign in automatically, or enter the OTP code provided on the login page if you prefer."
   
2. **Backend OTP Generation and Storage:**
   - Integrate logic to generate a secure OTP code when sending out the magic link email.
   - Ensure the OTP is stored securely (linked to the user's email or a temporary session) and is set to expire after a short duration (e.g., 10 minutes).
   - If the magic link is used, ensure the OTP is invalidated (and vice versa) to avoid reuse.

3. **Login Page Update:**
   - Update the login page UI to include an input field for the OTP code alongside the magic link option.
   - Implement logic to verify the OTP when the user submits it. On successful verification, log the user in.
   - Display clear error messages if the OTP is invalid or expired.

4. **User Experience & Error Handling:**
   - Clearly communicate on the login page that users have two options to log in.
   - Provide feedback (e.g., loading indicators, success/failure messages) for both the magic link and OTP methods.
   - Ensure that all interactions are secure and that the OTP cannot be reused.

5. **Security, Logging, and Documentation:**
   - Log OTP generation and verification events for auditing purposes.
   - Ensure that both the magic link and OTP flows adhere to our security best practices.
   - Add inline comments and documentation explaining the new hybrid authentication process, including how OTP generation, storage, and verification work.

Please implement these changes and confirm once the hybrid authentication process (magic link with optional OTP) is working as expected.
