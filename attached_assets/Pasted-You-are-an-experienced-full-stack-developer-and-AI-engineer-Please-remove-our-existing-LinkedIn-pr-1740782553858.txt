You are an experienced full-stack developer and AI engineer. 
Please remove our existing LinkedIn profile analyzer product and rebuild it from scratch with a new approach: 
we will rely on manual data entry (i.e., user copy-paste) rather than trying to scrape or access a URL.

-----------------------------
1. Product Overview & Flow
-----------------------------
- **User Flow**:
  1. **Landing Page**: Explains the benefits of optimizing a LinkedIn profile. 
  2. **Data Collection**: User manually copies and pastes their LinkedIn headline, summary, experience, etc., into text fields (or a single large text area).
  3. **AI Analysis & Feedback**: We send this pasted text to our AI service (OpenAI) for feedback, focusing on:
     - Keywords
     - SEO-friendly profile URLs
     - Engagement strategies
     - Profile photo best practices
     - All the tips provided below
  4. **Results Page**: Shows suggestions, best practices, and an actionable checklist.

- **Key Requirements**:
  1. We do NOT fetch the user’s LinkedIn profile automatically. 
  2. The user must paste their content (headline, summary, experiences) into our form.
  3. The AI then analyzes that text and returns suggestions for improvement.

------------------------------------
2. Integrate Best Practices & Tips
------------------------------------
Use these 20 best practice tips as reference points for AI suggestions and user feedback. 
They cover:
1. Relevant keywords
2. Customizing the LinkedIn URL
3. Regular content engagement
4. Profile pictures
5. Background photos
6. Headline optimization
7. Name pronunciation feature
8. Summaries as stories
9. Avoiding overused buzzwords
10. Growing and managing your network
11. Listing relevant skills
12. Getting endorsements and recommendations
13. Showcasing learning (LinkedIn Learning, certifications)
14. Sharing marketing collateral and relevant content
15. Commenting and engaging with influencer content
16. Turning on Creator Mode
17. Spotlighting services
18. Contributing to collaborative articles
19. Considering Sales Navigator for business growth

For each tip, the AI can highlight which ones the user is already following (based on their pasted text) and which ones they should adopt.

-------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Details
-------------------------------------------
1. **Front End**:
   - **Landing Page**:
     - Quick pitch on why a strong LinkedIn profile matters.
     - “Paste Your LinkedIn Content” button leading to the main form.
   - **Data Collection Form**:
     - Separate text fields or a single large text area for headline, summary, experience, etc.
     - Possibly add placeholders or instructions (e.g., “Paste your LinkedIn summary here”).
   - **Results Page**:
     - Display AI-generated suggestions referencing the 20 best practices.
     - Show a short actionable checklist (e.g., “Add at least one metric in your headline,” “Personalize your URL,” etc.).
   - **UI**: 
     - Keep it simple and clean. 
     - Possibly a progress bar or “completeness” score based on how many tips are satisfied.

2. **Back End & AI**:
   - Use Node.js/Express (or similar) to handle form submissions.
   - When the user submits text, call an OpenAI endpoint with a carefully crafted prompt:
     - “Here’s the user’s LinkedIn content. 
       Please analyze it against these 20 best practices. 
       Return suggestions on how to improve their profile.” 
     - Include the 20 tips in the prompt so the AI references them.
   - Parse the AI’s response and structure it into actionable items.

3. **Data Handling**:
   - Store user-submitted text in a database (or ephemeral memory if you prefer no long-term storage).
   - Provide an option for the user to save or download their results.
   - Ensure privacy and disclaimers about not scraping LinkedIn.

-------------------------------------
4. Testing & Final Steps
-------------------------------------
1. **Remove Old Product**:
   - Delete or comment out any old code that tried to fetch LinkedIn URLs or used a scraping approach.
   - Update readme/documentation to reflect the new manual data entry approach.
2. **Test the New Flow**:
   - Input sample LinkedIn text, confirm the AI suggestions reference the 20 tips (keywords, custom URL, photo best practices, etc.).
   - Check that each tip is addressed: if the user is missing a profile photo mention, the AI should recommend adding one; if the user hasn’t used a custom URL, it should prompt them to do so, etc.
3. **Share Code & Instructions**:
   - Provide me with the updated front-end components (LandingPage, DataCollectionForm, ResultsPage).
   - Show me how to configure the AI prompt in the backend. 
   - Confirm that the old product is fully removed and the new approach is functional.

That’s it! 
Please implement these changes, remove the old product code, and confirm the new manual data entry approach is fully working with the AI-driven suggestions referencing the 20 best practice tips.
