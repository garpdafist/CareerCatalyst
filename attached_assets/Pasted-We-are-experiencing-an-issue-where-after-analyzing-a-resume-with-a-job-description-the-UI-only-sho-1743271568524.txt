We are experiencing an issue where, after analyzing a resume with a job description, the UI only shows the CTA and none of the analysis fields (like score, general feedback, or primary keywords) are rendered. However, the logs indicate that the analysis was successfully processed and saved (e.g., analysis ID 107 with score 72, generalFeedbackContent, primaryKeywords, etc.).

Please perform the following debugging steps and apply necessary fixes:

1. **Inspect the Analysis Data Flow:**
   - Confirm that the API response for the analysis (when fetching /api/resume-analysis/107) includes all the expected fields.
   - Log the full analysis object in the component that is responsible for rendering the results (e.g., ResumeAnalysisInline). For instance, add a console.log to output the analysis data upon receipt.

2. **Review Conditional Rendering Logic:**
   - Examine the conditional checks in the ResumeAnalysisInline (or similar) component that determine whether to render each section (general feedback, primary keywords, etc.). Ensure that valid, non-empty data is not inadvertently filtered out.
   - Remove or adjust any fallback logic that might be causing the component to show only the CTA when some fields are missing.

3. **Verify Prop Drilling and Data Passing:**
   - Check that the parent component is correctly passing the full analysis object down to the ResumeAnalysisInline component.
   - If using context or global state (e.g., via React Query), confirm that the data is available and correctly structured in the component's props.

4. **Test with Sample Data:**
   - Temporarily hardcode a sample analysis object with all expected fields in the component to confirm that the UI renders it correctly. This will help isolate whether the issue is with data fetching or the rendering logic.

5. **Documentation & Logging:**
   - Add inline comments describing the expected data structure and the conditions for rendering each field.
   - Ensure that any placeholder or fallback values are removed so that only valid data is displayed.

Please implement these debugging steps and necessary fixes to ensure that when an analysis is available (like the one with ID 107), its score, general feedback, primary keywords, and other fields are properly rendered in the UI. Once done, confirm that the full analysis output is displayed instead of just the CTA.
