You are an experienced full-stack developer and AI/UX specialist. 
I want to enhance my resume-building product by applying the following rules and best practices, which are drawn from B-school/consulting-style marketing resumes:

----------------------------
RESUME RULES & BEST PRACTICES
----------------------------
1. **Overall Structure & Formatting**
   - Keep the resume to one page if possible.
   - Use clear, bold section headings and bullet points for achievements.
   - Maintain consistent fonts and spacing.

2. **Summary/Profile**
   - 2–3 sentences max, focusing on key strengths and marketing achievements.
   - Mention data-driven results (e.g., ROI improvements, user acquisition).

3. **Experience Section**
   - Emphasize quantifiable achievements with metrics (CPC, CTR, LTV, ROI).
   - Use action verbs and marketing-specific terms.
   - Keep bullet points concise (2–4 bullets per role), focusing on outcomes.

4. **Education Section**
   - Highlight relevant programs or courses if they enhance marketing credibility.
   - Keep details brief unless you’re a recent grad.

5. **Skills & Additional Section**
   - List core marketing tools, certifications, or languages.
   - Mention unique or conversation-worthy interests briefly.

6. **Criteria for a Strong Marketing Resume**
   - Data-driven achievements, clear impact statements, relevant marketing language.
   - Professional polish and consulting-style bullet points.

7. **Tailoring & Relevancy**
   - Show advanced marketing tools (GA, Firebase, Appsflyer, etc.).
   - Possibly add a “Key Achievements” section at the top.

------------------------------------
GOAL: UPDATE PRODUCT & AI SUGGESTIONS
------------------------------------
Please update the following aspects of our resume builder:

1. **Product Flow & Sections**:
   - Ensure each resume section (Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) encourages the user to follow these best practices.
   - Add prompts or placeholders that remind the user to include metrics (e.g., “Mention a % increase or cost savings”).
   - If we have a “Key Achievements” section, prompt the user to list top 2–3 data-driven wins.

2. **AI Suggestions**:
   - When the AI analyzes a resume, it should check for:
     - Quantifiable metrics (ROI, CTR, CPC, retention rates).
     - Action-oriented language (“Led,” “Optimized,” “Drove,” etc.).
     - Clear structure and bullet formatting.
   - Provide feedback if the user’s bullet points lack data or are too wordy.
   - Suggest ways to make statements more concise, results-oriented, and marketing-focused.

3. **UI/UX Enhancements**:
   - Add tooltips or inline tips that remind the user to keep bullets short and data-driven.
   - Possibly show a “resume quality score” reflecting these rules (metrics usage, clarity, formatting).

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - In the front end (ResumeEditor or similar component), incorporate placeholders or instructions that align with these rules.
   - In the AI analysis (server-side or client-side), revise the suggestion prompts to reflect B-school/consulting best practices. 
   - Let me know how you’ll structure the code changes (e.g., a “rules” file or object that the AI references).

5. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Provide a way to test the updated suggestions on sample resumes.
   - Show logs or examples of how the AI now flags missing metrics or non-action verbs.

Please share the updated code snippets and confirm that our product:
1) Guides users toward data-driven, consulting-style bullet points,
2) Encourages them to keep the resume structured and concise,
3) Improves AI feedback to highlight marketing achievements and metric-based results.
