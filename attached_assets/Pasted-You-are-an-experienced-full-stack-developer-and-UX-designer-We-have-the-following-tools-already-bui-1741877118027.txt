You are an experienced full-stack developer and UX designer. We have the following tools already built:
- A Cover Letter Generator (which we like, with a 5-step process: Target Role, Company Details, Key Achievements, Personal Brand, Output Format).
- A LinkedIn Profile Optimizer (which we want to make more user-friendly and produce better output).
- A Resume Analyzer and Editor.

We also want to ask the user (optionally) for a job description when they upload their resume, so the system can tailor the resume or cover letter to that specific role.

Here are the goals:
1. **Link the Tools Seamlessly**:
   - From the Resume Analyzer/Editor, let users jump to the Cover Letter Generator if they want a letter for the same role.
   - From the Editor or Cover Letter tool, offer a link to the LinkedIn Profile Optimizer if they want to optimize their headline/summary based on the same data.

2. **Improve LinkedIn Optimizer**:
   - Make it more user-friendly. Possibly mirror the 5-step flow (like the Cover Letter tool), or a simpler step approach: Headline → About → Current Role → etc.
   - Ensure the final output is better structured, with clear suggestions the user can copy and paste into LinkedIn (since we can’t use the LinkedIn API).

3. **Optional Job Description Input**:
   - When users upload a resume, ask if they have a job description. If yes, let them paste it so the Resume Analyzer or Cover Letter can be tailored to that role. 
   - If they skip it, the analysis remains general.

4. **Implementation & Testing**:
   - Add UI elements (buttons/links) to connect these tools. 
   - For the LinkedIn Optimizer, refine the layout or add a short wizard-like flow. 
   - Show me code snippets or a diff of how the job description input is integrated (like an optional text area or separate field).
   - Confirm each tool can still function independently if the user chooses to skip the job listing or skip the cover letter.

Let’s make sure the user can seamlessly move from Resume → Editor → Cover Letter → LinkedIn if they want, with an optional job description to tailor everything. Please implement these changes carefully and share the final UI or code diffs so I can review.
