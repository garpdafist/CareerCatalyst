You are an experienced UI/UX designer and front-end developer. 
I want to remove my existing design on https://career-catalyst-abhay46.replit.app/ across all pages and replace it with a fresh layout and style inspired by the “SmartIrrigation” landing page. 
Note: We are NOT building an irrigation product—this design is just a reference for visuals. 
Our actual product is a resume analyzer and career tool. 
Here’s what I need:

------------------------------------
1. Remove All Previous Design
------------------------------------
- Delete or comment out any old CSS, color palettes, or layout structures from every page (home, resume analyzer, resume editor, LinkedIn optimizer, etc.).
- Reset each page so we can build from scratch.

------------------------------------
2. Incorporate the New Design
------------------------------------
I want a style similar to the SmartIrrigation reference, but the content should focus on resume analysis and career tools:

A) **Layout & Sections** (across pages):
   - **Hero Section** (Home Page):
     - Large image or illustration (relevant to resumes/careers).
     - Bold headline (e.g., “Optimize Your Resume Effortlessly”).
     - Subtext about AI-driven improvements.
     - Two CTAs (“Get Started,” “Learn More”).
   - **Features / Why Choose Us**:
     - A grid or card-based layout for each page that needs to display features (e.g., Resume Analyzer, Editor).
     - Clean, minimal design with icons or small illustrations.
   - **Analytics or Metrics**:
     - If a page shows data (e.g., user stats, success rates), use a minimal, modern design with small charts or cards.
   - **CTA & Footer**:
     - Consistent final call-to-action across pages.
     - Footer with brand name, privacy policy, terms of service, contact info.

B) **Color Palette & Typography**:
   - Light, clean color scheme (white/off-white background, a gentle accent color for headings/buttons).
   - Replace any green or “garden” references with a color more suitable for a tech/career brand (e.g., teal, soft blue).
   - Headings: modern sans-serif (e.g., Poppins, Inter), with bolder weights for emphasis.
   - Body text: 14–16px, normal weight, comfortable line spacing.

C) **Component Styling**:
   - **Cards**: minimal boxes with subtle borders or shadows, icons at the top if needed.
   - **Buttons**:
     - Primary button with accent color, white text.
     - Secondary button with outline or lighter background.
   - **Consistent Spacing** (16–24px margins/padding).
   - Subtle hover effects (scale, shadow) for buttons and cards.

D) **Responsive & Micro-Interactions**:
   - Ensure each page is fully responsive.
   - Use slight transitions (0.2s) for hovers, focus states, and any interactive elements.

-----------------------------------
3. Implementation & Testing
-----------------------------------
1. **Front End**:
   - Apply this new design system to **all** pages (Home, Resume Analyzer, Editor, LinkedIn Profile, etc.).
   - Remove any leftover dark theme or conflicting CSS from the old design.
2. **Show Me the Updated Pages**:
   - Provide a working link on Replit where I can see the consistent new design across every page.
   - Confirm the hero, features, analytics, CTA, and footer all match the new aesthetic.
   - Make sure the color palette, typography, and component styling remain uniform site-wide.

Remember, we’re keeping the content about **resume analysis** and career improvement—NOT irrigation. The SmartIrrigation layout and styling are purely for visual inspiration.
