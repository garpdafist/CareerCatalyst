You are an experienced AI prompt engineer and back-end developer. The user has a resume and a job description, but the AI output doesn’t seem to reflect the JD thoroughly, and the score is often quite high. Please improve the logic:

1) **Enforce Job-Specific References**:
   - In the AI prompt, explicitly say: “You MUST incorporate relevant requirements from the job description into the final suggestions. Create a ‘Job-Specific Recommendations’ section with at least 2–3 bullet points that reference the job role’s requirements, skills, or experiences the user should emphasize.”
   - Also instruct the AI: “If a job description is provided, mention how the user’s resume can be aligned to that specific role or company.”

2) **Refine Scoring Logic**:
   - If we consistently get high scores (like 85 or 90) even for partial matches, consider adjusting the prompt or any weighting. 
   - Possibly reduce the default or instruct the AI to be more critical, e.g., “Score carefully, and do not inflate the rating if key job requirements are missing.”

3) **Ensure a Distinct “Job-Specific Recommendations” Section**:
   - The AI output should produce something like:
     "jobSpecificFeedback": [
       "Add more detail about your B2B marketing experience to match the job’s requirement for B2B campaigns.",
       "Highlight your experience with data tools or automation tools (e.g., Airtable, LinkedHelper) as listed in the JD."
     ]
   - This is separate from “Suggested Improvements,” which might be more general.

4) **Implementation & Testing**:
   - Update the system or user prompt to strongly require a dedicated “Job-Specific Recommendations” array. 
   - If no job description is present, the AI can skip or set that array to empty. 
   - Show me the final code snippet or diff where you changed the prompt and possibly the fallback logic.
   - Test with a known job description. Confirm the final JSON includes a “jobSpecificFeedback” or “jobSpecificRecommendations” field referencing the JD’s details. 
   - Also watch if the score is more realistic (not always 85+).

Let’s ensure the LLM truly references the JD and yields more accurate, job-focused suggestions, plus a more balanced scoring approach.
