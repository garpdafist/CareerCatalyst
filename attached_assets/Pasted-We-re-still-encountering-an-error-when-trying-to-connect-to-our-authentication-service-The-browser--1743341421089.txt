We're still encountering an error when trying to connect to our authentication service. The browser shows a message:

"Browser Security Restriction Detected
We're having trouble connecting to our authentication service. Your browser's security settings may be blocking the connection
Content Security Policy restrictions may be in effect
Sign-in may still work, but you might experience issues. If you continue to have problems, please try a different network connection.

Authentication Error
Cannot connect to authentication service. Please check your network connection."

We've confirmed that our Supabase project is now active and the keys have been updated. Please perform the following steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:

1. **Review Content Security Policy (CSP) Settings:**
   - Check our index.html (or server headers if applicable) to see if there's a CSP meta tag or HTTP header restricting external connections.
   - Update the CSP to allow connections to our Supabase endpoint, for example by adding "https://pwiysqqirjnjqacevzfp.supabase.co" to the connect-src directive.
   - Ensure any other relevant CSP directives (such as default-src) do not block external API calls.

2. **Verify Client-Side Supabase Configuration:**
   - Open the client/src/lib/supabase.ts file and confirm that the Supabase URL and keys are correctly set.
   - Log these values (without exposing secrets) to ensure the application is using the updated, active credentials.

3. **Network Diagnostics:**
   - Use the browser's network tab to inspect the failed requests to the Supabase endpoints. Check if any error details or blocked requests are visible.
   - Confirm that no local browser extensions or settings are interfering with network requests.

4. **Testing Connectivity:**
   - Attempt a direct fetch (using curl or similar) to "https://pwiysqqirjnjqacevzfp.supabase.co/health" from the same environment to verify that the endpoint is reachable.
   - Compare the results with the browser console errors.

5. **Documentation and Logging:**
   - Add inline comments in the code explaining the CSP changes.
   - Provide a brief summary of your findings and any adjustments made to the CSP or Supabase configuration.

Please implement these changes, then test and confirm that the authentication service is now accessible without triggering the browser security error.
