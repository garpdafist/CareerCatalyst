We need to update the CTAs on the Resume Analysis results page. Currently, we have three CTAs with the heading "Ready to Improve Your Resume?": 

• CTA 1: "Improve my resume"  
• CTA 2: "Generate cover letter"  
• Small CTA 3: "View previous resume analysis"  

The issues are:
- CTA 1 and CTA 2 are too long and spread out, making the layout look unbalanced.
- CTA 3 (the text link) is fine.

Please implement the following changes:

1. **Revamp CTA 1 and CTA 2:**
   - Combine CTA 1 ("Improve my resume") and CTA 2 ("Generate cover letter") into a compact, visually appealing button group.
   - Design CTA 1 as the primary action (e.g., with a bold color, larger size) and CTA 2 as a secondary action (e.g., outlined or with a lighter background).
   - Arrange these buttons side by side on desktop (and stacked on mobile if needed) to create a cohesive unit.
   - Use consistent padding, margins, and font sizes so they feel balanced and integrated.

2. **Maintain the Heading and CTA 3:**
   - Keep the heading "Ready to Improve Your Resume?" clearly displayed above the button group.
   - Leave CTA 3 ("View previous resume analysis") as a smaller text link placed below the button group, ensuring it remains unobtrusive.

3. **Evaluate Additional CTA Options:**
   - Consider whether these two primary CTAs are sufficient. If any additional CTAs are needed, ensure they do not overwhelm the user or lead to analysis paralysis.
   - For now, focus on just these two actions to streamline the user experience.

4. **Documentation & Consistency:**
   - Add inline comments explaining the styling choices (e.g., primary vs. secondary button classes) and the responsive layout logic.
   - Use our existing Tailwind CSS classes to maintain consistency with the rest of the app.

Please implement these changes and confirm once the new CTA layout is in place. The goal is to provide a clean, balanced, and intuitive call-to-action area that encourages users to take action without feeling overwhelmed.
