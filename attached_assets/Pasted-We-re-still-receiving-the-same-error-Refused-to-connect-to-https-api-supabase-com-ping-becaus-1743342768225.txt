We're still receiving the same error:

"Refused to connect to 'https://api.supabase.com/ping' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: 'default-src 'self'". 

It appears that despite our recent changes, the browser is still enforcing a restrictive CSP. We need to further diagnose and resolve this issue. Please take the following steps:

1. **Log the Actual CSP Header:**
   - Modify our security middleware to log the full Content Security Policy header that is being sent in the HTTP response.
   - Verify that this header includes an explicit `connect-src` directive allowing connections to "https://api.supabase.com" and "https://pwiysqqirjnjqacevzfp.supabase.co".

2. **Check for Overriding Configurations:**
   - Confirm that no other middleware (e.g., Helmet or a CDN service) is overriding our CSP settings.
   - Ensure that our custom CSP configuration is not being cached by the browser. If needed, clear the cache and test again.

3. **Temporary CSP Relaxation:**
   - Temporarily remove or relax the CSP header (e.g., set `connect-src *`) to confirm that the error disappears. This will help verify that the issue is solely related to CSP restrictions.
   - Once confirmed, reapply a stricter CSP that explicitly allows our Supabase domains.

4. **Refine the CSP Settings:**
   - Update the CSP to explicitly allow connections to:
     - "https://api.supabase.com"
     - "https://pwiysqqirjnjqacevzfp.supabase.co"
   - Example: `<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; connect-src 'self' https://api.supabase.com https://pwiysqqirjnjqacevzfp.supabase.co; ...">`

5. **Document and Test:**
   - Add inline comments explaining the CSP configuration changes.
   - Restart the server and test the authentication flow again.
   - Log the final CSP header and ensure that the authentication service can be reached without triggering errors.

Please implement these steps and confirm once the CSP is correctly configured and the error is resolved.
