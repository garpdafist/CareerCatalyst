Phase 4: Security Enhancements

Weâ€™ve made multiple updates to our system (new loading states, job flows, saved analyses), but now we must finalize security measures:

1. **Environment & Configuration Security**
   - Confirm that all sensitive environment variables (DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY, SESSION_SECRET, etc.) are only accessible server-side.
   - Verify that production settings (NEXTAUTH_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, DATABASE_URL) are correctly configured and not exposed in client code.

2. **API & Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting (e.g., using Redis or an in-memory store) for critical endpoints (resume analysis, job-specific analysis) to prevent spam or DDoS attacks.
   - Ensure error responses do not reveal sensitive details (like stack traces or DB info).

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Ensure only authenticated users can see or retrieve saved analyses. Tie each analysis to userId in the DB.
   - If admin features exist (like viewing all analyses), implement role-based checks or a separate admin area.

4. **CSRF & Input Validation**
   - Confirm we have CSRF protection for all POST requests, especially for session-based actions.
   - Use Zod or similar for consistent input validation on all routes (resume text, job description, etc.). 
   - Sanitize any user-generated content before storing or displaying.

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Integrate or confirm we have an error tracking solution (e.g., Sentry or Datadog).
   - Log key security events (login failures, repeated rate limit hits) for potential intrusion detection.
   - If feasible, set up alerts for unusual spikes in usage or errors.

6. **User Privacy & Data Retention**
   - Decide on a data retention policy for old analyses. Provide a way for users to delete their data if needed (compliance with GDPR/CCPA if relevant).
   - Document these policies in a Terms/Privacy page if not already done.

Please implement these security enhancements, ensuring our new flows (with job, saved analyses) are fully protected. Provide a summary of each change (e.g., new middleware for rate limiting, updated environment variable usage) so we can verify we meet industry best practices.
