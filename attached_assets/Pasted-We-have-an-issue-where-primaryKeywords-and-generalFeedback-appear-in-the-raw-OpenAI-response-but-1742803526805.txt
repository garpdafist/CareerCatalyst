We have an issue where "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" appear in the raw OpenAI response but are missing in the UI. Please diagnose and fix by performing a “backward” debugging trace and verifying our DB logic. Here’s the plan:

1. **Front-End (React) Fetch & Console Log**  
   - After fetching the analysis data, log it:
     ```js
     console.log("Fetched analysis data:", data);
     setAnalysisData(data);
     ```
   - If "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" are missing here, the issue is server-side or DB-side.

2. **Check the Server Route’s Final Response**  
   - Right before `return res.json(result);` in the Express route, log the object:
     ```js
     console.log("Final response to client:", JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));
     ```
   - Confirm "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" are present.

3. **Database Storage & Retrieval**  
   - In the function that saves the analysis (e.g., "saveResumeAnalysis"), verify we include "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" in the insert statement, and that the DB schema has columns for them.
   - When retrieving data, ensure we SELECT or fetch those columns. Log the DB result to confirm the fields exist.

4. **Hard-Code a Test Response**  
   - Create a simple route (e.g., "/api/test-debug") that returns:
     ```js
     res.json({
       primaryKeywords: ["Keyword1", "Keyword2"],
       generalFeedback: { overall: "Test feedback" }
     });
     ```
   - If the front-end displays these correctly, the UI is fine, and the problem lies in how we build or fetch the real analysis response.

5. **Search for Typos or Inconsistent Naming**  
   - Use your IDE’s find-in-files for "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" to ensure consistent naming across:
     - AI response parsing
     - DB insert and retrieval
     - Final `res.json(...)`
     - React’s fetch and render code

Please implement these steps, log each stage, and fix any naming mismatches or missing DB columns so that "primaryKeywords" and "generalFeedback" appear in the final UI.
