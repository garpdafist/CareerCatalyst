Design Brief for Job Match Analysis (First Design)
Overall Layout & Structure

Use a clean, minimalist design with a light cream/off-white background (#FAF9F5 or similar)
Organize content into clear sections with generous whitespace between them
Use a hierarchical heading structure with the main title "Job Match Analysis" at the top in bold black text
Create four distinct sections: "Alignment & Strengths," "Gaps & Concerns," "How to Tailor Your Resume," and "Overall Fit Assessment"

Typography

Use a modern sans-serif font throughout (likely Arial, Helvetica or similar)
Main title: 24-28px, bold
Section headings: 20-22px, medium weight
Content text: 16-18px, regular weight
Blue recommendation text: slightly larger than standard text

Color Scheme

Background: Light cream/off-white
Section titles: Dark gray/black
Strengths items: Green text (#3D9970 or similar) with green checkmark icons
Gaps/concerns: Red text (#E74C3C or similar) with red X icons
Recommendations: Blue text (#4A90E2 or similar) with blue arrow icons
Information icon: Light gray/blue in the assessment section

Content Containers

Create subtle rounded rectangle containers with very light background colors for each content item:

Strengths items: Very light green background (#E6F7EF or similar)
Gaps items: Very light red/pink background (#FEECEC or similar)
Recommendations: Very light blue background (#EEF4FD or similar)
Assessment: White background with thin gray border



Icons

Green checkmarks (✓) before each strength
Red X marks (✗) before each gap/concern
Blue right-facing arrows (→) before each recommendation
Information/note icon (ⓘ) before the assessment summary

Content Specifications

Strengths section: Include 2 green-highlighted items with checkmarks
Gaps section: Include 2 red-highlighted items with X marks
Recommendations section: Include 3 blue-highlighted items with arrows
Assessment section: Include 1 summary statement with information icon

Content Style Differences

First design focuses on digital marketing content creation and entrepreneurial experience
First design mentions lack of professional summary as a gap
First design suggests adding professional summary, metrics, and certifications
First design includes an overall assessment section at the bottom

Responsive Considerations

Ensure all text remains readable at various screen sizes
Maintain padding consistency within container elements
Allow containers to expand vertically based on content needs

This design creates a clear, visually organized job match analysis that effectively distinguishes between strengths, gaps, and tailoring recommendations with a professional appearance that's easy to scan and understand.
