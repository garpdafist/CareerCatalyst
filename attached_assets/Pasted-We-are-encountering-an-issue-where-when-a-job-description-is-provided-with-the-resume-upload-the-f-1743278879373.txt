We are encountering an issue where, when a job description is provided with the resume upload, the final analysis result does not include any job description data. The logs indicate that although a job description is sent in the request (with length 3238, etc.), later in the process it shows "Job description info: { exists: false, type: 'undefined', length: 0, preview: 'undefined' }" and the saved analysis has hasJobDescription set to false.

Please perform the following steps to diagnose and fix the issue:

1. **Trace the Job Description Processing:**
   - Add detailed logging at every stage where the job description should be processed:
     a. Log the raw request payload to verify that the jobDescription field is present.
     b. Log the results after schema validation to confirm that the jobDescription is correctly recognized and parsed.
     c. Log the job description data just before it is appended to the AI prompt for both the GPT-3.5 initial analysis and the GPT-4 comprehensive analysis.
     d. Log the job description value immediately after the AI returns the analysis, to see if the field is included in the AI response.
     e. Log the final analysis object right before saving it to the database.

2. **Review Schema and Fallback Logic:**
   - Examine the validation schema (using Zod or similar) to ensure that the jobDescription field is optional but, if provided, correctly stored as a string.
   - Check for any fallback logic that might be inadvertently overriding a provided job description (e.g., setting job description to "none" or undefined).

3. **Review AI Prompt Construction:**
   - Verify that when a job description is provided, it is properly incorporated into the AI prompt. Confirm that no conditions are unintentionally skipping the job description segment.

4. **Identify and Fix the Issue:**
   - Based on the logs, determine at which point the job description data is lost or altered.
   - Apply necessary changes so that if a job description is provided in the request, it is processed and included in the final analysis result (with hasJobDescription set to true and the corresponding fields populated).

5. **Testing and Documentation:**
   - After applying fixes, test the complete flow by uploading a resume with a job description.
   - Verify in the logs that the job description is correctly processed and that the final saved analysis includes the job description details.
   - Add inline comments to document the changes made and the expected flow for handling job description data.

Please implement these debugging steps and necessary fixes, then confirm once the job description is correctly processed in the analysis results.
