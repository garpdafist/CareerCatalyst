You are an experienced front-end developer and animation specialist. 
I want to implement an **animated path or trail** progress bar on my career/resume website. 
Here are the specific details:

------------------------------------------------
1. Thematic Concept
------------------------------------------------
- Since this is a career-focused site, use a small icon or character that fits the niche: 
  - Possibly a **briefcase icon** or a **person silhouette** in a suit. 
  - As progress increases, the icon moves along a curved or winding path, visually representing the user’s resume-building journey.

------------------------------------------------
2. Visual & Animation Details
------------------------------------------------
- **Path Design**:
  - Create an **SVG path** that arcs or curves across a horizontal space (e.g., a subtle S-curve). 
  - The path color should match my site’s color scheme (e.g., a light accent color). 
  - The background remains transparent or minimal so it can overlay the site’s background.

- **Icon Movement**:
  - The icon should start at the left (0% progress) and end at the right (100% progress). 
  - As progress changes, the icon smoothly transitions along the path, possibly with an easing function for a natural feel (e.g., ease-in-out).

- **Progress Calculation**:
  - If the user’s resume completeness is 70%, the icon should appear ~70% along the path. 
  - The path’s total length can be measured using `getTotalLength()` on the SVG path. 
  - Then we can use a fraction of that length (0 to path length) to position the icon.

- **Micro-Interactions**:
  - The icon can slightly bounce or scale up upon certain milestones (e.g., 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%). 
  - Possibly change the path color or show a small text label (“70% complete”) near the icon as it moves.

------------------------------------------------
3. Implementation Approach
------------------------------------------------
- **SVG + JavaScript**:
  1. Define an `<svg>` with a `<path>` element. 
  2. Use JavaScript or a library (like **GSAP** or plain CSS animations) to move the icon along the path. 
  3. For example, if you use GSAP, you can do something like:
     ```js
     gsap.to("#progressIcon", {
       duration: 1,
       motionPath: {
         path: "#progressPath",
         align: "#progressPath",
         alignOrigin: [0.5, 0.5],
         start: 0,
         end: progressFraction
       }
     });
     ```
- **React or Vanilla**:
  - If using React, create a `ProgressPath` component. 
  - If vanilla JS, just reference the `<svg>` IDs in your script.

------------------------------------------------
4. Resume Niche Customization
------------------------------------------------
- **Icon Options**:
  - A **briefcase** or **graduation cap** to symbolize career progress. 
  - A **person silhouette** with a tie or professional outfit. 
  - Ensure it’s a small SVG or PNG with a transparent background.

- **Milestones**:
  - If the user hits 50% completeness, show a small tooltip: “Halfway There!” 
  - At 100%, the icon could do a celebratory bounce or glow.

------------------------------------------------
5. Provide the Code & Preview
------------------------------------------------
- Please create a minimal working example:
  - An `<svg>` with a path (ID = "progressPath").
  - An icon or `<circle>` (ID = "progressIcon") that moves along the path.
  - JavaScript logic that updates the icon’s position based on the user’s resume progress (0–100).
- Share the updated Replit link or code snippet so I can test the animation. 
- Make sure the design matches my site’s color scheme (e.g., a neutral background, accent path color, etc.).

By implementing this **animated path/trail progress bar**, we’ll have a **visually engaging** representation of a user’s resume-building progress that fits the career/resume theme.
