You are an experienced full-stack developer and AI engineer. 
I want to update our LinkedIn Profile Optimizer so it only collects data for the user’s last two jobs in a structured manner, rather than asking for all experience at once. 

---------------------------
A) Product Requirements
---------------------------
1. **Form for Most Recent Job**:
   - Fields:
     - Job Title (e.g., “Senior Marketing Manager”)
     - Company Name
     - Start & End Dates (or “Present”)
     - Key Achievements & Responsibilities (2–3 bullet points, each with metrics if possible)
   - Show short best-practice tooltips:
     - Use action verbs (“Led,” “Optimized,” “Drove”)
     - Include at least one metric or data point
     - Keep bullet points concise

2. **Form for Second Most Recent Job**:
   - Identical structure to the first form (title, company, dates, bullet points).
   - Same best-practice tips.

3. **Data Storage & Flow**:
   - Collect the user’s input from these two jobs in a structured format (JSON or DB records).
   - We will later merge this data with other profile info (e.g., headline, summary) for AI analysis.
   - Do NOT ask for older roles—only these last two jobs.

----------------------------
B) Implementation Details
----------------------------
- **Front End**:
  - Possibly a two-step wizard or two separate forms. 
  - Provide a “Next” or “Add Another Job” button to move from the first job to the second.
  - Display best-practice tips inline or in a sidebar.

- **Back End**:
  - Use Node.js/Express (or similar) to handle form submissions.
  - Store each job’s data in a database or in-memory object, keyed to the current user session.

--------------------------
C) Final Steps & Testing
--------------------------
1. After implementing, show me how each form is displayed and how the data is saved.
2. Confirm we only collect these two jobs.
3. Prepare the code so we can easily pass this structured data to our AI prompt in a later step (e.g., “Analyze Profile”).

Please implement these changes now, removing any older approach that tried to capture a full job history at once.
