You are an experienced full-stack and AI developer. I want to remove all existing job listing functionality and focus exclusively on an AI-powered resume analyzer with a marketing focus. Please implement the following changes:

1. **Remove Job Listings & Clean Up Code**
   - Delete or comment out any routes, components, or database schemas related to job listings.
   - Update navigation/UI to remove job-related pages and references.

2. **Database & Resume Storage**
   - Create a new 'resumes' collection (or table) to store each user’s resume data and AI analysis.
   - Include fields like:
     - userId
     - resumeContent (text or file reference)
     - analysisResults (JSON of the AI feedback)
     - timestamps (createdAt, updatedAt)
   - Ensure only the owner of the resume can access or delete it.

3. **Enhanced Resume Analyzer (Marketing Focus)**
   - Expand the AI analysis to emphasize marketing roles, metrics, and relevant keywords (e.g., ROI, CTR, campaign budgets, analytics tools).
   - Return a “score” or rating for each resume based on keyword matches, structure, and marketing-related achievements.
   - Display the **scoring criteria** to the user as a **hover tooltip** (e.g., “Score is based on marketing keywords, metrics, structure, etc.”).

4. **Modern, User-Friendly Authentication**
   - Implement a **passwordless login** (magic link) or another simple flow (e.g., social login with Google or LinkedIn).
   - Minimize friction so users can quickly upload a resume and view their analysis.

5. **Add UI Buttons for Future Features**
   - On the main dashboard or resume analysis page, add **buttons** (or links) for:
     - **“Role Fit”** suggestions (future product)
     - **“Career Path”** recommendations (future product)
   - For now, these buttons should be **placeholders** that show a simple modal or message: “Coming Soon!”

6. **User Interface & Flow**
   - Maintain a single-page flow for resume upload, analysis results, and new placeholders (Role Fit, Career Paths).
   - Ensure the analysis page includes:
     - Resume Score
     - Detailed feedback categories (skills, keywords, improvements)
     - Hover tooltips explaining how each category is scored

7. **Final Touches & Testing**
   - Confirm that OpenAI integration still works with the new marketing-focused prompts.
   - Provide me with instructions on how to run and test everything within Replit.

Please scaffold all these changes in the existing codebase, remove any outdated references to job listings, and ensure the final UI reflects a marketing-centric resume analyzer with user-friendly authentication and placeholders for upcoming features.
