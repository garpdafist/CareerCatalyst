You are an experienced front-end developer and AI prompt engineer. The raw AI response includes a “generalFeedback” object with { overall, strengths, actionItems } but the final UI shows “No general feedback available” or incomplete data. Please fix:

1) **Match Raw AI Fields to UI**:
   - In the raw response, we have something like:
     {
       "score": 78,
       "identifiedSkills": [...],
       "suggestedImprovements": [...],
       "generalFeedback": {
         "overall": "...",
         "strengths": [...],
         "actionItems": [...]
       }
     }
   - Ensure the UI references `analysis.generalFeedback.overall` for the main paragraph, `analysis.generalFeedback.strengths` for “Key Strengths,” and `analysis.generalFeedback.actionItems` for “Priority Action Items.”

2) **Remove/Adjust Fallback Overwrites**:
   - If we have fallback logic that sets `analysis.generalFeedback = "No general feedback available"` or overwrites partial data, remove it or only apply it if `analysis.generalFeedback` is truly undefined.
   - This way, if the AI returns `analysis.generalFeedback.overall`, we display it.

3) **Ensure the Score is Correct**:
   - The raw AI response shows `"score": 78` but the final UI might show 85 or 75. Possibly we are referencing an older or fallback field.
   - Double-check we’re using `analysis.score` from the raw response, not a leftover or fallback.

4) **Implementation & Testing**:
   - Show me a final code snippet or diff in the front-end (resume-analyzer.tsx or similar) that:
     - Properly destructures or references `analysis.generalFeedback.overall`, `analysis.generalFeedback.strengths`, `analysis.generalFeedback.actionItems`.
     - Removes any fallback that overwrote the actual data.
     - Uses `analysis.score` from the AI response for the final displayed score.
   - After changes, test with the same resume to confirm the UI displays the correct “overall” feedback text, lists strengths, action items, and the correct numeric score.

This should unify the raw AI response fields with the final UI so we see the correct “overall” feedback, strengths, action items, and consistent scoring.
