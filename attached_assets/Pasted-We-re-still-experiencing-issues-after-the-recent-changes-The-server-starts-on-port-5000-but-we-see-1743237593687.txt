We’re still experiencing issues after the recent changes. The server starts on port 5000, but we see a “Request timeout” when calling /api/resume-analyze, and only /api/config is returning 304 or 200. We also have a Tailwind warning about the class "after:ease-[cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)]" being ambiguous. Please help debug and fix the following:

1. **Check the Resume-Analyze Route**  
   - In server/routes.ts (or wherever we define Express routes), confirm we have a valid POST or GET handler for "/api/resume-analyze."  
   - Ensure we import and register this route in the main server/index.ts (or app) file.  
   - Log inside the route to confirm it’s called. If it’s not, we may have a missing or incorrect route path.

2. **Investigate the Request Timeout**  
   - If the route is registered, check if the code inside takes too long or never responds. Add logs at the start/end of the handler to see if we’re missing a `res.send()` or `res.json()`.  
   - Verify any AI calls or DB operations complete. If it’s a long process, consider increasing a timeout or returning partial results.

3. **Fix the Tailwind Utility Warning**  
   - The class "after:ease-[cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)]" is ambiguous. Replace it with backticks or bracket syntax, for example:
     ```css
     after:ease-[cubic-bezier(0.34,1.56,0.64,1)]
     ```
     to ensure Tailwind recognizes it as a custom utility rather than content.

4. **Check PORT Environment Variable**  
   - The logs say “(process.env.PORT=undefined).” Make sure we set `const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;` in server/index.ts or wherever we start Express.  
   - If Replit requires a specific port, confirm we’re using that.

5. **Confirm the Final Logs**  
   - After making these changes, kill all node processes (“pkill -f node” if needed) and run “npm run dev” again.  
   - Ensure the logs show the route is registered, the server is listening on port 5000 (or process.env.PORT), and no warnings prevent the route from responding.

Please implement these fixes so that /api/resume-analyze responds correctly and the Tailwind warning is resolved.
